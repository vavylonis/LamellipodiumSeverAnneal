Simulation of lamellipodial actin network turnover

This code simulates a dendritic actin network undergoing retrograde flow, including processes of filament severing into oligomers and annealing. This code was developed for the simulations in D. Holz, A. R. Hall, E. Usukura, S. Yamashiro, N. Watanabe and D. Vavylonis (bioRxiv https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.03.31.437985)
